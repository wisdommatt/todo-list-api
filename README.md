# Todo List API

Todo List REST API written in Go (Golang).

## Explanation

This is a task management api sample project.

To avoid unnecessary complexity and overengineering i decided to:

* Use just logs rather than implementing tracing with open telemetry.
* Maintain a simple folder structure.
* Write less tests for duplicated use cases (mainly because it's an sample project)

## Testing

I did not test all parts of the codebase to avoid spending too much time on the project, since this is just a sample/dummy project.

To show how i test my codebase i have a sample full coverage test for each use case.

* [Service Layer](components/users/service_test.go)
* [HTTP Handlers](http-handlers/users_test.go)

## Database

This API uses mongodb as the primary database.

## How to execute / use

* Using docker **(recommended)** run `docker-compose up` and connect to `localhost:5555`
* Using local mongodb and go installation, run `go run main.go` then adjust environment variables in `.env` to fit your current setup.
